        unzip main.zip && rm main.zip

2. Edit the variables in *blips_shscript.sh* in blips/scripts

3. Run the blips initiator script: 

        cd <project_directory>/blips/scripts
        sbatch blips_initiator.sh

4. Download the results from (2) and run ShinyR DAM

5. Upload the results from (3) to Secretariat

6. Edit the variables in streamline script: *streamline_shscript2.0.sh*

7. Run the streamline initiator script: 

        cd <project_directory>/streamline2.0/scripts
        sbatch streamline_initiator2.0.sh
