Please refer to the README and INSTRUCTIONS documents in the blips and streamline2.0 directories for more information on each "package"

## Packages

- **blips**: Process blips generated by DAM monitors and fix the blips pre-ShinyR DAM
- **streamline2.0**: Process post-ShinyR DAM output data for streamline analysis

## Steps

1. Download a zip file of the repository to your working directory on Secretariat

        cd <project_directory_path>
        wget 'https://github.com/ypan23-1876660/DAM/archive/refs/heads/main.zip'
        unzip main.zip && rm main.zip

   > Make sure you are logged into the head / login node (*secretariat-master*) for this step!

2. Edit the variables in *blips_shscript.sh* in blips/scripts

3. Run the blips initiator script: 

        cd <project_directory_path>/blips/scripts
        sbatch blips_initiator.sh

4. Download the results from (2) and run ShinyR DAM

5. Upload the results from (3) to Secretariat

6. Edit the variables in *streamline_shscript2.0.sh* in streamline2.0/scripts

7. Run the streamline2.0 initiator script: 

        cd <project_directory_path>/streamline2.0/scripts
        sbatch streamline_initiator2.0.sh

8. Download the results for further analysis (e.g. SAS)
